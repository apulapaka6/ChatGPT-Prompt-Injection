## Overview

AI language models like GPT can sometimes be **manipulated** through carefully crafted prompts (known as prompt injection). In this project, you’ll find:
- A **README** describing the context of the attack and ethical considerations.
- A **Prompt Injection Study.md** file with detailed logs of the prompt and responses.

## Contents

- **README.md**: You are currently viewing it.  
- **PromptInjectionExample.md**: Shows the exact prompt injection text, model responses, and commentary.

## Usage Notes

1. **Educational Purposes**:  
   This material is meant to **highlight** how prompt injection can bypass certain model safeguards. Do not use it for malicious or harmful activities.

2. **Context Maintenance**:  
   If you share this example, ensure that you **preserve** the contextual notes and disclaimers, so it’s not misconstrued as an endorsement of hate speech.

3. **Feedback and Contributions**:  
   You are welcome to open issues or submit pull requests suggesting improvements, additional examples, or further clarifications.

## Ethical Considerations

- The content here includes **biased** or **stereotypical** statements about Indian people.  
- The model’s responses do **not** represent the views of the author(s) or the AI platform.  
- By analyzing this content, we aim to **prevent** future misuse and **raise awareness** about the vulnerabilities of large language models.
